### About Me

I graduated the Msc. Computational Sciences at the University of Amsterdam in 2021 with a GPA of 7.7 (out of 10). Furthermore I did a bachelor in Biomedical Sciences. 

Since I started a minor in programming during my Bsc. Biomedical Sciences I got intrigued by Data Science and the impact of data-driven choices. This is why I taught myself to program and started a Msc. in Computational Sciences. During this master I focussed on Network Modelling, Data Mining, Complex System Simualtion and Stochastic Similations.
